The idea is simple. Iterate over all the symbols and put them into a stack. When we reach a `)` 
we pop all items into another stack and insert a left parenthesis '(' and then we push the items back again.

When we reach the end we will have the complete expression from the stack in reverse. So we need to print them in reverse.

```java
static String parseExpr(String expr) {
    Stack in = new Stack < Character > ();
    Stack out = new Stack < Character > ();
    for (char c: expr.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == ' ') {
            continue;
        }
        if (c == ')') {
