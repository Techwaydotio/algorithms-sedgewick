# Solutions to Algorithms Forth Edition

![cover](assets/book-cover.png)

## Getting Started

This **[website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)** contains nearly complete solutions to the textbook - [**Algorithms, 4th Edition**](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), published by [Robert Sedgewick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)) and Kevin Wayne.
I hope to organize solutions to help people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, this page is much more readable on portable devices.

## How I Generate the Website?

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the theme [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) to build this website.

We use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for rendering math expressions, which is fast and beautiful.
